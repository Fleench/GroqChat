# GroqChat

GroqChat is a minimal command-line chat interface for Groq's language model. The script stores chat history locally so you can resume conversations at any time. Messages are shown with Markdown formatting, and you can switch models on the fly.

Chat history is kept in the `chat_history/` folder with two subdirectories:
* `autosave/`  – files automatically created while chatting
* `userchat/` – chats you explicitly save with `/save`

Run `python cli.py sort` to create these folders and organise any existing files.
Run `python cli.py convert` to update old `.chat` files to version 1.0.

## Usage

1. **Create a `.env` file**

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env and set GROQ_API_KEY and APP_KEY
   ```

   `APP_KEY` is the required HTTP header value used by the web server.
   Development mode is enabled by default. Set `DEV_MODE=false` in `.env`
   to require the `x-app-key` header when deploying to production.

2. **Install dependencies**

   Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the chat CLI**

   Launch the interface with:

   ```bash
   python cli.py
   ```

### Commands

- `/new` start a new chat session
- `/save <name>` save the current chat
- `/load <name>` load a saved chat
- `/chats` browse chat history starting with a list of subdirectories
- `/prompt new <name>` create a reusable prompt
- `/prompt use <name>` send a saved prompt as your message
- `/prompt sys <name>` set the system prompt from a saved prompt
  (you will be prompted for a message afterwards)
- `/prompt list` list saved prompts
- `/summary` generate a summary of the current conversation
- `/search <term>` find messages containing a term in the current chat
- `/export <name>` save the chat as Markdown or text
- `/model <name>` switch to a different model
- `/model select` open a UI to choose a model
- `/info` display the active filename, model and message count

The chat interface automatically trims context to the most recent 10
messages. The system prompt is always included when sending requests to
the model. Chat history files now store metadata such as the chat name,
model and format version in addition to the message list. A short chat name
is automatically generated by the AI after your first message.


## Web app

A simple FastAPI-based web interface is available in `server.py`.
Install the extra dependencies and run the server:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open the displayed address in a browser on any device. The left sidebar lists
your saved chats from the `autosave` and `userchat` folders.
